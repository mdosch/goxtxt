# goxtxt
A xmpp twtxt bot written in go

## about

This bot enables you to tweet with [twtxt][2] by sending a message via [xmpp][3]. 
Created with try and error hacking on [this example][1].
This is the first programming I did since programming some ÂµC in 
C and programming PLCs during my studies and I have to admit I didn't take 
the time to properly dive into programming.

So consider this a study to see how far you can get with some very basic 
knowledge, 'trial and error' and searching in the docs. Anyway 
recommendations how to do better are welcome.

## requirements

* [go][4]
* [twtxt client][5]
* [coreutils][6]
* [util-linux][7]

## installation

If you have *[GOPATH][8]* set just run this command:

```
$ go install github.com/mdosch/goxtxt
```

You will find the binary in `$GOPATH/bin` or, if set, `$GOBIN`.

## configuration

The configuration is expected at `$HOME/.config/goxtxt/config.json` with this format:

```
{
    "Address": "example.com:5222",
    "BotJid": "bot@example.com",
    "Password": "ChangeThis!",
    "ControlJid": "user@example.com",
    "Twtxtnick": "mdosch",
    "TimelineEntries": 10,
    "MaxCharacters": 140
}
```
