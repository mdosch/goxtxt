# goxtxt
A xmpp twtxt bot written in go

This bot enables you to tweet with [twtxt][2] by sending a message via [xmpp][3]. 
Created with try and error hacking on [this example][1].
This is the first programming I did since doing programming some ÂµC in 
C and programming PLCs in my studies and I have to admit I didn't take 
the time to properly dive into programming.

So consider this a study to see how far you can get with some very basic 
knowledge, 'trial and error' and searching in the docs. Anyway 
recommendations how to do better are welcome.
